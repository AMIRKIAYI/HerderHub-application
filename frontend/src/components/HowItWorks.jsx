        HerderHub is designed to connect herders and buyers in a seamless and user-friendly manner. Here is how it works:
      </p>
      
      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-700 mt-4">1. Sign Up and Create an Account</h3>
      <p className="text-gray-600 mt-1">
        Start by signing up for a free account on HerderHub. This will allow you to manage your livestock listings and interact with potential buyers.
      </p>
      
      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-700 mt-4">2. Post Your Livestock</h3>
      <p className="text-gray-600 mt-1">
        Once your account is set up, you can easily post your livestock for sale. Fill in details such as breed, age, weight, and price, and upload clear photos of your animals.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-700 mt-4">3. Browse Listings</h3>
      <p className="text-gray-600 mt-1">
        Buyers can browse through various listings based on their preferences. The platform allows filtering options based on animal type, price range, and location.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-700 mt-4">4. Contact Sellers</h3>
      <p className="text-gray-600 mt-1">
        Interested buyers can contact sellers directly through the platform to negotiate prices or ask for more information about specific animals.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-700 mt-4">5. Complete the Sale</h3>
      <p className="text-gray-600 mt-1">
        Once both parties agree on the terms, the sale can be completed. We recommend meeting in a public place for safety during the transaction.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-700 mt-4">6. Feedback and Reviews</h3>
      <p className="text-gray-600 mt-1">
        After the sale, both buyers and sellers can leave feedback. This helps to build trust within the HerderHub community and improve the overall experience for everyone.
